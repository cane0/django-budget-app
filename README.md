"# budget-web-app" 
A scalable and extendable web application that is used for the management of budget for
daily, weekly and monthly basis. This app lets the users see in which category they spend
the most, months in which they spend the most as well as the days in simple readable form
as well as pictorial form such as Histogram and pie charts. The web application is built 62%
on python (django framework and its dependencies), 27.6% on HTML for the User Interface
structure, 5.0% on CSS for the styles of the User Interface structures and 5.4% on
Javascript for the functionalities of the User Interface without needing to interact directly
with the database. The database management software used is sqlite3 but if the need for
the app grows it can be migrated to a more appropriate database management software
